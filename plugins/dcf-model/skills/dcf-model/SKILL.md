description: Real DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model creation for equity valuation. Retrieves financial data from SEC filings and analyst reports, builds comprehensive cash flow projections with proper WACC calculations, performs sensitivity analysis, and outputs professional Excel models with executive summaries. Use when users need to value a company using DCF methodology, request intrinsic value analysis, or ask for detailed financial modeling with growth projections and terminal value calculations.

# DCF Model Builder

## Overview
Institutional-quality DCF models for equity valuation following investment banking standards.
Each analysis produces a detailed Excel model (with sensitivity analysis at bottom of DCF sheet).

## Preflight: Dependency Check

Before starting, verify required libraries and tools are installed and install any that are missing.

```bash
python3 -c "import openpyxl" 2>/dev/null || python3 -m pip install openpyxl
command -v soffice >/dev/null 2>&1 || command -v libreoffice >/dev/null 2>&1 || ls /Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "WARNING: LibreOffice not found. Install: brew install --cask libreoffice (macOS) or apt install libreoffice (Linux). Required for scripts/recalc.py."
```

**Important**: Do not skip this step — `scripts/recalc.py` and `scripts/validate_dcf.py` need these tools to verify sensitivity tables and TV-as-%-of-EV sanity checks.

## Scripts

- `scripts/recalc.py` — Force formula recalculation via headless LibreOffice. Run after building: `python scripts/recalc.py <model.xlsx>`
- `scripts/validate_dcf.py` — DCF-specific validation (terminal growth < WACC, WACC in 5-20% range, TV as 40-80% of EV, formula errors). Run after recalc: `python scripts/validate_dcf.py <model.xlsx>`

## Tools
- Default to using all information provided by the user and MCP servers available for data sourcing.

## Critical Constraints - Read These First

### Environment: Office JS vs Python/openpyxl
- Office JS: Use range.formulas = [["=D19*(1+$B$8)"]] — never range.values for derived cells
- Python/openpyxl: Write ws["D15"] = "=D14*(1+Assumptions!$B$5)", then run recalc.py
- Office JS merged cell pitfall: Write value to top-left cell alone, then merge + format

### Formulas Over Hardcodes (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Every projection/margin/discount factor/PV/sensitivity cell MUST be live Excel formula
- Only permitted hardcodes: (1) raw historical inputs, (2) assumption drivers, (3) current market data
- "If you catch yourself computing something in Python and writing the result — STOP"

### Verify Step-by-Step With the User (DO NOT build end-to-end)
1. After data retrieval → confirm raw inputs
2. After revenue projections → confirm top line + growth rates
3. After FCF build → confirm FCF schedule logic
4. After WACC → confirm calculation + inputs
5. After terminal value + PV → confirm equity bridge
6. After sensitivity tables → final review

### Sensitivity Tables
- Use ODD number of rows/columns (5×5 or 7×7)
- Center cell = base case (must equal model's actual implied share price)
- Highlight center cell with #BDD7EE + bold
- Populate ALL cells with full DCF recalculation formulas (75 total for 3 tables)
- NO placeholder text, NO linear approximations

### Cell Comments
- Add AS each hardcoded value is created
- Format: "Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Reference], [URL]"
- Never defer to end or write "TODO: add source"

### Model Layout Planning
- Define ALL section row positions BEFORE writing formulas
- Write ALL headers → section dividers → THEN formulas

## DCF Process Workflow

### Step 1: Data Retrieval and Validation
- Priority: MCP Servers → User-Provided Data → Web Search/Fetch
- Validation: net debt vs net cash, diluted shares, historical margins, growth rates, tax rate

### Step 2: Historical Analysis (3-5 years)
- Revenue growth trends (CAGR), margin progression, capital intensity, WC efficiency, return metrics

### Step 3: Build Revenue Projections
- Revenue(Year N) = Revenue(Year N-1) × (1 + Growth Rate)
- Three-scenario approach: Bear/Base/Bull
- Growth rates: Year 1-2 higher → Year 3-4 moderate → Year 5+ approaching terminal

### Step 4: Operating Expense Modeling
- S&M, R&D, G&A — ALL percentages based on REVENUE, not gross profit
- Model operating leverage: % should decline as revenue scales

### Step 5: Free Cash Flow Calculation
- EBIT → (-)Taxes → NOPAT → (+)D&A → (-)CapEx → (-)ΔNWC → Unlevered FCF

### Step 6: Cost of Capital (WACC) Research
- CAPM: Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta × ERP
- After-Tax Cost of Debt = Pre-Tax × (1 - Tax Rate)
- WACC = (Ke × We) + (Kd × Wd)

### Step 7: Discount Rate Application
- Mid-year convention: periods 0.5, 1.5, 2.5...
- Discount Factor = 1 / (1 + WACC)^Period

### Step 8: Terminal Value Calculation
- Perpetuity Growth: TV = Terminal FCF / (WACC - g)
- Exit Multiple: TV = Final Year EBITDA × Exit Multiple
- Sanity check: TV should be 50-70% of EV

### Step 9: Enterprise to Equity Value Bridge
- Sum PV FCFs + PV Terminal Value = EV
- EV - Net Debt = Equity Value
- Equity Value / Diluted Shares = Implied Price per Share

### Step 10: Sensitivity Analysis
Three tables: (1) WACC vs Terminal Growth, (2) Revenue Growth vs EBIT Margin, (3) Beta vs Risk-Free Rate

## <correct_patterns> section
- Scenario Block Selection: INDEX/consolidation column approach (not scattered IF statements)
- Revenue Projection: Reference consolidation column
- FCF Formula: Use consolidation columns with INDEX
- Cell Comment Format: exact source with date/URL
- Assumption Table Structure: 3 elements per block (header + column headers + data rows)
- Row Planning Process: headers first → dividers → formulas
- Sensitivity Table: 5×5 grid, symmetric axes, center = base case, formula in every cell

## <common_mistakes> section
- WRONG: Linear approximations in sensitivity tables
- WRONG: Placeholder text instead of formulas
- WRONG: Missing cell comments
- WRONG: Formula row references off (write formulas before headers)
- WRONG: Single row per assumption across scenarios
- WRONG: No borders
- WRONG: Wrong font colors
- WRONG: OpEx based on Gross Profit instead of Revenue
- TOP 5 ERRORS: row references, comments, sensitivity, scenario references, borders

- Column headers: Terminal growth [base-2Δ, base-Δ, base, base+Δ, base+2Δ] (e.g., 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%)
- Each cell formula recalculates: Sum PV FCFs (using row WACC) + PV TV (using col growth & row WACC) - Net Debt / Shares
- Center cell = base case implied price, highlighted #BDD7EE + bold

TABLE 2: Revenue Growth vs EBIT Margin → Implied Share Price
- Row headers: Revenue growth rates (Year 1)
- Column headers: EBIT margins
- Each cell recalculates full DCF with substituted assumptions

TABLE 3: Beta vs Risk-Free Rate → Implied Share Price

- Column headers: Risk-free rate values
- Each cell recalculates WACC → full DCF
Implementation (programmatic loop):

# Pseudocode for all 3 tables × 5×5 = 75 cells
wacc_range = [base_wacc - 0.01, base_wacc - 0.005, base_wacc, base_wacc + 0.005, base_wacc + 0.01]
tg_range = [base_tg - 0.01, base_tg - 0.005, base_tg, base_tg + 0.005, base_tg + 0.01]

for r, wacc in enumerate(wacc_range):
    for c, tg in enumerate(tg_range):
        # Formula references row header ($A$row) for WACC, column header (col$header_row) for TG
        formula = "=(<sum_pv_fcfs_using_$A${row}_as_wacc> + <tv_using_{col}${header}_as_growth_and_$A${row}_as_wacc> - <net_debt>) / <shares>"
        ws.cell(row=start_row+r, column=start_col+c).value = formula

Quality Rubric (Full)

## Quality Rubric

Every DCF model must maximize for:
1. **Realistic revenue and margin assumptions** based on historical performance
   - Growth rates justified by industry trends and company-specific drivers
   - Margin progression consistent with scale economics
2. **Appropriate cost of capital calculation** with proper CAPM methodology
   - Risk-free rate = current 10Y Treasury
   - Beta from reliable source (5-year monthly)
   - ERP within standard range (5.0-6.0%)
3. **Comprehensive sensitivity analysis** showing valuation ranges
   - Three 5×5 tables, all 75 cells with live formulas
   - Center cell = base case, highlighted
4. **Clear terminal value calculation** with supporting rationale
   - Both perpetuity and exit multiple methods
   - TV as % of EV sanity check
5. **Professional model structure** enabling scenario analysis
   - Bear/Base/Bull with consolidation columns
   - Clean cell references, no scattered IF statements
6. **Transparent documentation** of all key assumptions
   - Cell comments on every hardcoded input
   - Source citations with dates and URLs
